question B
size 100
sort 249ms
insertion_sort  10172ms
size 1000
sort 2937ms
insertion_sort 1015410ms
size 100000

insertion_sort 107533000ms
size 1000000
sort 374874ms
insertion_sort 
the sort and bubble sort time complex is nlogn n^2 respectively
as the size scale rising,the time the compiler needs will make a large diffference
the results are above
